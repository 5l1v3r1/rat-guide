### :heavy_exclamation_mark: &nbsp; README &nbsp; :heavy_exclamation_mark:

I made this repository to help new-comers in malware development to easily learn and figure out how to make a RAT in python3. <br>

I've always wondered, "how do most attackers make a RAT in a programming language, like in python?". <br>
However, most research I got was, well... not the best.

So, I made this project as a way of providing basic knowledge on RATs, networking, python, pip, and the socket library.

**You can read the guide [here](https://github.com/Lin8x/rat-guide/blob/master/networkterms.md)**
